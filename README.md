# spark-getting-started
Source code from an affiliated blog post, which is currently in progress.

This tutorial consists of three parts:
1.  Part 1 involves setting up a basic SBT Spark project in IntelliJ
2.  Part 2 performs basic ETL and simple analysis of a data file consisting of water-quality data
3.  Part 3 (not yet completed) investigates different mechanisms for persisting RDDs in Spark.

The repository includes all of the code developed during the course of the tutorial development.  Artifacts created in earlier parts are preserved so that they can be referenced by readers who are still completing the earlier parts of the tutorial.

Highly recommended:  The O'Reilly book Learning Spark; see http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028512.do.
